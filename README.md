# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS + Vuelidate + Supabase 

This is a boilerplate for  the tech stack above. In order for the forms to work, you'll need to have a supabase instance and anon key set up. Once that is done, you can create a ``.env`` file and add them there (see ``.example.env``).

Note that this is not responsive, and the form could use a little more fleshing out (validation, confirm password, etc).
